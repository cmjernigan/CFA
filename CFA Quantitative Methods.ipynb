    "Interest rates can be thought of in three ways:  \n",
    "**required rates of return** - the minimum rate of return an investor must receive in order to accept the investment  \n",
    "**discount rates** - rate of return that reflects the relationship between differently dated cash flows  \n",
    "**opportunity cost** - value that investors forgo by choosing a particular course of action  \n",
    "\n",
    "r = Real risk-free interest rate + Inflation premium + Default risk premium + Liquidity premium + Maturity premium\n",
    "\n",
    "**real risk-free interest rate** - single-period interest rate for a completely risk-free security if no inflation were expected  \n",
    "**inflation premium** - An extra return that compensates investors for expected inflation.; reflects the average inflation rate expected over the maturity of the debt  \n",
    "**nominal risk-free interest rate** - sum of the real risk-free interest rate and the inflation premium  \n",
    "**default risk premium** - An extra return that compensates investors for the possibility that the borrower will fail to make a promised payment at the contracted time and in the contracted amount.  \n",
    "**liquidity premium** - An extra return that compensates investors for the risk of loss relative to an investment’s fair value if the investment needs to be converted to cash quickly.  \n",
    "**maturity premium** - An extra return that compensates investors for the increased sensitivity of the market value of debt to a change in market interest rates as maturity is extended.  "
